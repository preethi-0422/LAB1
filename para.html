    <h1>About Git and GitHub</h1>
    <p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project, keeps a history of changes, and makes it easy to go back to an earlier version if needed.</p>
    <p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a platform that uses Git to store and manage code online. It allows developers to collaborate, share their projects, and contribute to others' work. GitHub also makes it easier to review code, report issues, and manage software projects.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, Git is the software tool, and GitHub is the place to use it online with others!</p>
